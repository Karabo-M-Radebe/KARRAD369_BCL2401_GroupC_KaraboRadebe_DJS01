### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge




##### Problem Areas to Address

1. **Unit Mismatch**: The provided functions fail to convert units correctly, leading to calculation inaccuracies.
2. **Parameter Misalignment**: Parameters are not handled in a way that prevents or highlights the potential for unit mismatch errors, leading to possible confusion.






# Project Overview
The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations. This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations.

# Project Brief
1. **Identify and Understand Errors**: Analyse the provided functions to determine how unit mismatches and parameter misalignments cause incorrect results.
2. **Refactor and Correct**: Modify the functions to handle parameters more effectively, incorporating object destructuring for clarity and implementing necessary unit conversions.

##### Expected Corrected Results
- New Velocity: Approximately 48880 km/h after correction.
- New Distance: Approximately 10000 km after correction.
- Remaining Fuel: Approximately 3,200 kg after correction.

### Areas of mastery 

### Challenges faced 
- One of the main challenges I faced in this project was having to find a way to make the calculations robust such that the calculation does not give an incorrect result. Unsure whether this was a comprehension issue or a technical issue from my end but I struggled greatly with that  

### Areas of Improvement 
- Throwing errors when there are calculations included: I need to improve on how I throw, catch and handle errors more effectively and know which functions to use in order to achieve this result.
