// Given Parameters
const vel = 10000; // velocity (km/h)
const acc = 3; // acceleration (m/s^2)
const time = 3600; // seconds (1 hour)
const d = 0; // distance (km)
const fuel = 5000; // remaining fuel (kg)
const fbr = 0.5; // fuel burn rate (kg/s)

// Function that converts the units of measurement from meters to kilometers and from seconds to hours 
function unitConversion (acc, time) {
  const accInKmH = acc*3.6;  //(Km/h)
  const timeInHr = time/3600; // hours

const {accInKmH, timeInHr} = unitConversion(acc, time); //called the variables to the global scope so that I could use them as arguments  

const d2 = d + (vel*timeInHr) //calcultes new distance - and I had to make sure it is in the correct unit of measurement 
const rf = fuel - (fbr*time) //calculates remaining fuel
const vel2 = calcNewVel(vel, accInKmH, time) //calculates new velocity based on acceleration

// Pick up an error with how the function below is called and make it robust to such errors
